    <h2>Welcome to FGC, a non-profit for Free Learning on Real Life Development of Dynamic Web Applications Using LAMP, with PHP and open-source software.</h2> 
    <h3>The web applications streamline the procedures in refurbishing computers and associated items, which go through the process of intake, triage, build, quality check, inventory, sales, scrapping/recycling, and financial accounting.  This is supported by a time management system which keeps track of volunteer orientation, training, activities done and certificates, contributed hours, and earned/redeemed reward points.  Future modules will include monitoring of free classes on introduction to computers, programming languages, etc.</h3>

    <h4>Below Are Example Output of the Web Application Currently Under Development:</4>

    <ul>
        <h1><li><a href='laptops4sale.html'>Laptops for Sale</li></h1>
        <h1><li><a href='desktops4sale.html'>Desktops for Sale</li></h1>
